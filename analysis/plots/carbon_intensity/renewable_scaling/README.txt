regarding amplifying renewable percentage, I took a year worth of data in 2022 and aggregated them over a day period, and plotted:
1. the average carbon intensity under the current renewable percentage/ratio,
2. the current renewable ratio
3. the hypothetical carbon intensity under a fixed higher renewable percentage.
